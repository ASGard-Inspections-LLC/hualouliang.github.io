## Postdoc Position in Biomedical Deep Learning  
(<span style="color:red">updated on 10/1/2019</span>)

I have an immediate opening for a post-doctoral fellow to engage in a federally-funded multi-year project in 
biomedical deep learning. My research group at Drexel University focuses on developing state-of-the art deep learning-based 
algorithms and applying them to a wide range of problems. Ongoing projects are: 

* Design of novel and application of existing cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) 
models (e.g. Transformer, BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) for biomedical information retrieval and text summarization. 
This is an unprecedented opportunity to harness unstructured information from millions of documents, 
use this information to guide generic drug product development. 

* Development of novel and application of existing deep generative models (e.g. GANs, VAEs) to explain the 
high-dimensional structure and time course of neural population activity. The focus is on the extraction of 
low-dimensional temporal patterns in high-dimensional spiking and local field potentials datasets in visual attention 
and working memory tasks, and the development of new tools for causal inference 
(e.g. [copula Granger-causality](https://liang-lab.org/software/)). 

The ideal candidate should have, or be about to receive, a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline with substantial 
computational experience (especially in deep learning/NLP). Programming skills in Python and/or Julia are essential. 
Knowledge of state-of-the-art NLP/text mining methods and/or deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch) 
is advantageous but not required.

Interested individuals should email a curriculum vitae and a brief statement of research interests 
to [Dr. Hualou Liang](mailto:hualou.liang@drexel.edu).
