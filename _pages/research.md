* **Natural language processing (NLP)**
  - Design of novel and application of existing cutting-edge NLP models (e.g. Transformer, BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) for biomedical information retrieval and text summarization. This is an unprecedented opportunity to harness unstructured information from millions of documents, use this information to guide generic drug product development.  
  - Using brain activity (e.g. fMRI) to interpret NLP models and guide model development. 
* **Development of novel and application of existing deep generative models (e.g. GANs, VAEs) to explain the high-dimensional structure and time course of neural population activity.** The focus is on the extraction of low-dimensional temporal patterns in high-dimensional spiking and local field potentials datasets in visual attention and working memory tasks, and the development of new tools for causal inference (e.g. [copula Granger causality](https://liang-lab.org/software/)). 
* **Deep learning for brain age prediction using multimodal neuroimaging data (structural MRI, DTI and resting-state fMRI)**
* **Hippocampus-neocortex communication for memory consolidation**
