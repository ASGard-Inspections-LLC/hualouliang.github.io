Hualou Liang, PhD, is a Professor of [Biomedical Engineering](https://drexel.edu/biomed/) at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/). He is affiliated with the [Computational Neuroscience Initiative](https://cni.upenn.edu/) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/). He is known for pioneering the application of causal functional connectivity measures, particularly Granger causality, to the analysis of complex, high-dimensional neuroscience data. He is an elected Fellow of the American Institute for Medical Biological Engineering (AIMBE).

His research experience throughout years ranges from areas in biomedical data analysis, machine learning to cognitive and computational neuroscience. His lab explores neural mechanisms of visual perception during various cognitive tasks using computational approaches. His recent work deals with (1) development of [software package](http://www.brain-smart.org/) for analyzing brain circuits, (2) neuronal oscillations and attentional control, (3) development of advanced signal processing methods for the analysis of nonstationary, multivariate neurobiological data (spikes, field potentials, EEG/MEG, fMRI etc), and (4) algorithm development for brain-computer interface or brain-machine Interface.
