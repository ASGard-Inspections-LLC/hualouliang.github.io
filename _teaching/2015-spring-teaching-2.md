The emergence of big data, machine learning algorithms, and increased computing power has enabled significant breakthrough in neural networks and related applications. This class will discuss recent progress and findings in the exciting field of deep learning. While mathematical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the deep learning tools and technical aspects needed to solve the data science problems in biomedicine. Besides the construction by students of computer simulations of important deep neural networks, the class will also show how to develop deep learning applications in the Cloud. Selected applications in computational neuroscience, computational biology, medical imaging, and electronic medical records will be discussed.
