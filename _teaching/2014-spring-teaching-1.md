Biomedical engineering is at the interface of mathematics, engineering, and biology / medicine. This course will be on the mathematical analysis of biomedical engineering systems. As the first course in the Biosimulation sequence, it will emphasize analytical methods and the development of models. This course will provide the foundations for the modeling  and mathematical analysis of biomedical engineering systems, with an emphasis on differential equations and an introduction to probabilistic methods. In general, the focus will be on analytical techniques, setting the stage for BMES673, which introduces numerical methods and other advanced computational techniques for solving applied problems. Modeling and specific biological and biomedical applications will be introduced through examples and experience.
